TOP Foundations Course JS project 1


This is one of my first JavaScript program built from scratch.

It is meant to demonstrate my ability to plan out a functioning application, using most, if not all, methods previously learned.

CC is short for "Computer controlled player"
step 1
how rock-paper-scissors is played:

    two players agree and begin to play,

    they decide if they are going to show 1 of three options:
    rock
    paper
    scissors

    from either perspective:
    if rock is played:

        it will win scissors is played.
        it will lose if paper is played.
    
    if paper is played:

        it will win if rock is played.
        it will lose if scissors is played.
    
    if scissors is played:

        it will win if paper is played.
        it will lose if rock is played.
    
    if both players close the same option, it is a draw and a
    reroll can be decided.
