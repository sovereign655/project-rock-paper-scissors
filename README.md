# Rock Paper Scissors

Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors project, a part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course. This is one of my first JavaScript programs built from scratch. It's meant to demonstrate my ability to plan out a functioning application, using most, if not all, methods previously learned to create a rock-paper-scissors web app.

## Installation

To play the Rock Paper Scissors game, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Once you've installed and opened the game, you can start playing by choosing either rock, paper, or scissors. The computer will also make a choice, and the winner will be determined according to the classic rules of the game.
The first to reach a score of 5 is declared winner, restarting the game will restart the game rounds.
